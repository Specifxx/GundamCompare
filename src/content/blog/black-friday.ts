<p>Black Friday is Friday 27 November 2026 and Cyber Monday is Monday 30 November. Plenty of stores will run sales on Gundam Card Game that week, and some start earlier. The one thing worth doing before then is knowing what each product costs today, so you can tell a real deal from a normal price with a red sticker on it.</p>
<p>Below are today's prices for the newest sets' sealed product: TCGplayer's market price, and the cheapest in-stock store listing we found. These tables are rebuilt from every day's prices, so they are the prices to beat right up to Cyber Monday. For the deals themselves, our <a href="/black-friday">Gundam Black Friday deals</a> page lists everything stores sell under TCGplayer's market price today, in every country we cover, and <a href="/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday deals</a> does the same that weekend.</p>

<h2>Today's prices to beat</h2>

<p>Every product links to its page, which compares every store, eBay and TCGplayer for it, cheapest in stock first. Switch the market at the top of any page for stores in your country, in your own currency.</p>

<h2>How to tell a real Black Friday deal</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Compare with today's price, not the "was" price or the MSRP.</b> Many Gundam Card Game products already sell under their list price at the cheapest store. A "Black Friday price" that matches what the cheapest store charges every week is not a deal.</li>
<li><b>Count the shipping.</b> A box a few dollars cheaper at a store with $15 shipping costs more than a dearer one with free shipping over a threshold. Our <a href="/tools/best-basket">best basket</a> tool prices a whole order, shipping included.</li>
<li><b>Check it is in stock.</b> A low price on a pre-order or a backorder is a promise, not a box. Our tables only count in-stock listings.</li>
<li><b>Be careful with prices far under everyone else.</b> A sealed product at half the price of every other store is more often a mistake, a different product or a resealed box than a sale. Buy sealed product from a store you trust, and check the wrap.</li>
<li><b>Codes rarely stack on sealed.</b> Stores often leave booster boxes out of site-wide percentage codes. Read the terms before you count the discount.</li>
</ol>

<h2>When to buy</h2>
<p>If a product you want is already at a good price today, waiting for Black Friday can cost more than it saves: popular sealed product sells out in December. If it is not, bookmark the <a href="/black-friday">Black Friday deals</a> page, which updates every day through the sales, or set a price alert on the product's page and we will email you when it drops.</p>
